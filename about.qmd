Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

For almost a decade I ran a small tech company creating Python solutions for the market research industry. In the summer of 2024 we were acquired - ðŸŽ‰ - so now I can concentrate fully on technology insted of sales. This site is my attempt to get back into the loop on tech and stay up to date.

The blog runs on Quarto, is hosted on GitHub, and every post is a Jupyter Notebook. The whole thing is open source if you want to have a spin, and the notebooks should run in Google Colab if you want to try them for yourself. 

Feel free to reach out, connect, or just say hi!
