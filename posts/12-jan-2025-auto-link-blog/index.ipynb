By setting up custom instructions in a Claude Project, he can have Claude write full-featured scripts that include dependencies without needing extra installation steps. Using uv run, a tool for running inline script dependencies, the author can create and run these one-shot scripts directly from URLs or prompts, making it easy to build tools like a debug script for Amazon S3 buckets or a web server with an API.\n",
