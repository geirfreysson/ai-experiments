    "[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) is a Python library for building AI web apps. I've been using a lot recently - including in my [Fantasy Premier League chatbot](/posts/2025-03-23-talking-to-data-with-a-chatbot/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio's superpower is how easy it is to get started with, while still offering the depth and flexibility to build much more advanced applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradio's Journey to 1 Million Users\n",
    "The Hugging Face blog recently posted about a Gradio milestone: [\"Journey to 1 Million Gradio Users!\"](https://huggingface.co/blog/gradio-1m). It shows that Gradio's success is no accident. The team shares thought-provoking philosophies that helped them on their journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out most to me was their choice not to focus on high-level abstractions, but instead to build solid, flexible primitives. This helped them avoid several common pitfalls:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Customization-maintenance trap**: high-level abstractions are easy to use, but users request extra parameters to customize them, which in turn leads to increased maintenance burden since every abstraction and parameter needs to be implemented, maintained, and tested to avoid bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The productivity illusion:** using high-level abstractions seems like less work, until a user needs functionality that is not supported (which can be hard to predict at the beginning of a project), forcing the developer to do a costly rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## gr.ChatInterface\n",
    "To this day, Gradio only includes two high-level abstractions (`gr.Interface` and `gr.ChatInterface`) which are themselves built with low-level primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, launching a chatbot is as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gradio as gr\n",
    "\n",
    "def echo(message, history):\n",
    "    return message\n",
    "\n",
    "demo = gr.ChatInterface(fn=echo, type=\"messages\", examples=[\"hello\", \"hola\", \"merhaba\"], title=\"Echo Bot\")\n",
    "demo.launch()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This simple chatbot can then be expanded step by step, until you have a fully fledged chatbot with bells and whistles, without ever outgrowing Gradio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The start-up killer\n",
    "The customization-maintenance trap is a productivity killer — and often a startup killer too. I’ve struggled with it many times, and seen fellow founders sink into that particular quicksand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This focus also helps explain why Gradio is such good software. By avoiding dozens of custom high-level widgets and sticking to strong fundamentals, they’ve built a product that’s genuinely a joy to use."
