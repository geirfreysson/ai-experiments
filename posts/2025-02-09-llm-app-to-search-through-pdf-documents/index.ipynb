It mentions specific LLMs such as GPT, Llama, and Gemini, which can use in-context learning to summarize content. However, the challenge remains for query-focused abstractive summarization over an entire corpus, as the volume of text can exceed the limits of LLM context windows. The text also mentions the possibility of using an alternative form of pre-indexing to support a new RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approach for global summarization. This information is relevant to the query as it discusses the use of LLMs in searching and summarizing documents.</td>\n",
