    "The first AI agentic editor I fell in love with was [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/). Back in March, I typed in the long string of numbers from my credit card and took the plunge.  \n",

    "## Enter Claude Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I started hearing the buzz around Claude 4 - specifically, **Claude Code**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re vibe coding, drop Windsurf, Cursor, VS Code, or whatever else you’re using and try Claude Code immediately. It’s a level above the rest.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, it’s an arms race - another provider could overtake them any day - but right now Claude Code is in a class of its own. And even if you’re not using it, you should read [Best Practices for Agentic Coding](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices) from Anthropic. It’s an eye‑opener, especially the tips on creating Markdown files with guidelines for how the agent should work.  \n",

    "## Amazon's new editor Kiro\n",
    "Just as I was learning how powerful planning with Markdown files can be for vibe coding, Amazon launches Kiro.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses Claude as a default model and its \"spec mode\" helps you to work according to Anthropic's best practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a clever idea - so much so that Amazon had to impose a waiting list for the new editor.  \n",

    "## Sticking with Claude Code\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying Kiro for a few days, I realised something: Claude Code itself is simply a better agent. Even with meticulous specs, Kiro couldn’t match it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I haven’t cancelled my Windsurf subscription yet - it’s a handy backup when I hit my Claude quota. But for my day‑to‑day vibe coding, I’m sticking with any editor that integrates smoothly with Claude Code. It’s my go‑to.\n"
